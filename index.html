            <p><span class="whiteText"> In our modern world conflict, and the desire of the powerful have taken over. AWOKE news is here today to highlight the injustice that occurs today. We are proud to cover news that people are scared to show because of corruption and threats. I would like to than Gaurdian, BBC, Knesset, Daily Sabah CNN and Al Jazeera for giving us these invaluable information for the article that we made on the current Israel-Palestine conflict. We would like to thank BBC for their article on Venezuela. Thank you so much for reading it again </span></p>
